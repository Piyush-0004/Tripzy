# Authentication & Authorization

* Only **logged-in users** can create listings or reviews.
* Only the **listing owner** can edit or delete a listing.
* Middleware handles route protection and user validation.


##  Cloudinary Image Upload

Images are uploaded through **Multer** and stored in **Cloudinary**. Only the image URLs are stored in MongoDB. Cloudinary's CDN serves the images to ensure fast and optimized delivery.

Example flow:

1. User submits listing with image.
2. Image is uploaded to Cloudinary via Multer middleware.
3. Cloudinary returns a secure URL.
4. That URL is stored in MongoDB and used in your EJS templates.

*  Add geolocation support via Mapbox or Google Maps
*  Add availability calendar for bookings
*  Add unit and integration tests (Jest/Supertest)
*  Add multi-language support
